Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

_Example 1:_

Input: x = 121

Output: true

Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

_Example 2:_

Input: x = -121

Output: false

Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

_Example 3:_

Input: x = 10

Output: false

Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
 

**Constraints:**

-231 <= x <= 231 - 1
 

Follow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?
